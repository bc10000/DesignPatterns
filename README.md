# DesignPatterns

Creational Designs are all about class instantiation or object creation
They include Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Singleton, Object Pool, and Prototype

Structural Design Patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures,
they include patterns such as Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Private Class Data, and proxy

Behavorial are about indentifying common communication patterns between objects and realizing these patterns.
they include chain of responsbility, command, interpreter , iterator, mediator, memento, Null object, observer, state, Strategy,
template method, visitor.

Summuary of patterns:

Singleton Pattern: its Job is to maintain a single instance (object) throughout the lifetime of the program.
Factroy Pattern:   A single static function in the base class which produces derived classes objects.
Observer Pattern : one to many relationship, think of the youtube channel and subscriber, where a pulisher uploads a new video, and each subscriber
                   gets notified.
Decorator Pattern : Adds differernt AddOns to a basic base object, i.e adding a scope or a magazine to an AK47
Adapter Pattern : a wrapper class that maps new inputs to old inputs
